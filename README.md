# Machine Learning / Deep Learning Projects
This repository contains the code for the predictive model trained on the dataset (from publicly available datasets on Kaggle).

The list of projects is as follows - 

### 1. Mushroom Classification
#### Safe to Eat or Deadly Poison?
This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one.
