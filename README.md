# Machine Learning / Deep Learning Projects
This repository contains the code for the predictive model trained on the dataset (from publicly available datasets on Kaggle).

The list of projects is as follows - 

### 1. Mushroom Classification
#### Safe to Eat or Deadly Poison?
This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom drawn from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. 

### 2. Chest X-Ray Images (Penumonia)
#### Normal? Bacterial Pneumonia? Viral Pneumonia?
Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.

For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.
